## Interests

Apart from being a software engineer, I am the father of a baby which takes most of my time. When he sleeps I work on home projects.

I like to have an active lifestyle, in winter I'd like to go swimming while in summer hiking is my passion. I looking forward to my baby growing strong to hike with me.

I also like going to live music concerts, enjoying the great gastronomy of nortern Spain, and sometimes I homebrew beer.
